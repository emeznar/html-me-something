			<h1> Pebble Watchfaces </h1>
			<p> Pebble has some really interesting smart watches currently on the market and the direction
				they are taking in future development appears to be very promising. What sets them apart
				from other smart watches is that they have incorporated an open source concept into their
				products meaning any function can be customized whithin the limits of the hardware. Instead
				of having drag and drop watchface apps that allow you to "customize" the look of a watch,
				Pebble has a cloud development site that lets you upload code creating a watchface
				completely from a blank screen. With a little C code and javascript, anything is possible!

				Some of the watchfaces I have created are listed below. Feel free to take a look at them
				and if you are interested in them, click the link at the bottom of the page for more
				information.

					<h2 id = 'cool'>Cool or Rugged <h2>
					<p> These watchfaces are cool with a little more rugged feel.
						They tend to have a more masculine theme, but would still
						be considered unisex. They display time in 24hr format and
						also display date, step count, battery life, and weather.

				<section>
					<h2 id = 'lighter'>Lighter &#8209 not so tough <h2>
					<p> These watchfaces have a lighter feel with lighter colors and
						would definitely be considered unisex. Some display time in
						24hr format while others include 12hr format with AM or PM.
						Like the others, these watchfaces display date and track step
						count, battery life, and weather.
